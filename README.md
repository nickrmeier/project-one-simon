# project-one-simon

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
This game is based off of the SIMON game, developed in the 1970's as a toy with programming by Lenny Cope. 

The object of the game is to repeat a pattern determined by a random generator. At the beginning of each round, a new random value is added at the end of the pattern. The player must repeat the original pattern plus the new value to move onto the next round.

<!-- FEATURES -->
1. FOUR LIGHTS/BUTTONS - each light/button is a different color. Lights flash yellow when clicked on by the player, or when in the pattern array chosen by the computer.

2. PLAY BUTTON - This starts the game. Once this is pressed, the game chooses the first random value and the corresponding button lights up. An event listener turns on and any button clicked is entered into an array. 

5. COUNTER - This keeps track of which round is being played. This version of the game goes up to five rounds.

6. WINNER ALERT - If the player gets to round 5 and is successful in replicating the pattern, an alert window pups up saying "YOU WIN!"
